We begin by defining the variables as seen in figure 1. 
We assume the sun is orbiting in a plane parallel to the x-y plane, at some height, $h$, above the ground, with orbital radius, $R$. We place the origin of our coordinate system at the observer, yielding the following vector-valued position of the sun

$$\vec{s} = x(t)\hat{i}+y(t)\hat{j}+z(t)\hat{k}$$

where, 

$$x(t) = m+Rcos(2\pi ft)$$

$$y(t) = n+Rsin(2\pi ft)$$

$$z(t) = h$$


With the following parameter definitions:

$$Sun orbit centered at (m,n)$$

$$R: Sun orbit radius$$

$$f=1/T, where T=24 hrs$$

$$t: time of day, in hrs$$
