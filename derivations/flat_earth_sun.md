We begin by defining the variables as seen in figure 1. 
We assume the sun is orbiting in a plane parallel to the x-y plane, at some height, $h$, above the ground, with orbital radius, $R$. We place the origin of our coordinate system at the observer, yielding the following vector-valued position of the sun

$$\vec{s} = \<x(t), y(t), z(t)\>$$
