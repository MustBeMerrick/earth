We begin by defining the variables as seen in figure 1. 
We assume the sun is orbiting in a plane parallel to the x-y plane, at some height, $h$, above the ground, with orbital radius, $R$. We place the origin of our coordinate system at the observer, yielding the following vector-valued position of the sun

$$\vec{s} = x(t)\hat{i}+y(t)\hat{j}+z(t)\hat{k}$$

where, 

$$x(t) = m+Rcos(2\pi ft - \frac{pi}{2})$$

$$y(t) = n-Rsin(2\pi ft - \frac{pi}{2})$$

$$z(t) = h$$


With the following parameter definitions:

<p align=center> Sun orbit centered at $(m,n)$ </p>
<p align=center> $R$: Sun orbit radius </p>
<p align=center> $f=1/T$, where $T=24$ hrs </p>
<p align=center> $t$: time of day, in hrs </p>
