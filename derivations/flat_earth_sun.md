We begin by defining the variables as seen in figure 1. 
We assume the sun is orbiting in a plane parallel to the x-y plane, at some height, $h$, above the ground, with orbital radius, $R$. We place the origin of our coordinate system at the observer, yielding the following vector-valued position of the sun

$$\vec{s} = x(t)\hat{i}+y(t)\hat{j}+z(t)\hat{k}$$

where, 

$$x(t) = m+Rcos(2\pi ft)$$

$$y(t) = n+Rsin(2\pi ft)$$

$$z(t) = h$$


With the following parameter definitions:

<center>Sun orbit centered at $(m,n)$</center>

<center>$R$: Sun orbit radius</center>

<center>$f=1/T$, where T=24 hrs</center>

<center>$t$: time of day, in hrs</center>
